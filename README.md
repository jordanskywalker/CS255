1. Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
   
The DriverPass project focused on designing a system to help students prepare for driving tests. The client, DriverPass, requested a platform that offered online practice tests, on-the-road training scheduling, and integration with DMV requirements to provide updated materials.

2. What did you do particularly well?
   
I excelled at translating client requirements into actionable designs. My work on the technical specifications and user-centered features ensured the system addressed both functional and nonfunctional needs effectively.

3. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
   
I would revise the UML diagrams by adding more depth and detail, particularly in illustrating relationships and attributes. This would enhance the clarity and usability of the diagrams.

4. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
   
I interpreted the user's needs by focusing on their pain points, such as lack of accessible preparation tools, and implemented features like progress tracking and secure scheduling. Considering user needs ensures the system is functional, intuitive, and aligned with their goals, making it more likely to succeed.

5. How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
    
My approach begins with thorough requirement analysis, followed by iterative design and feedback loops. In the future, I plan to adopt agile methodologies and incorporate robust testing phases to refine and enhance system designs further.
